## 🖌️ Figma Notes

- Duplicate the original Figma file into your drafts to inspect and copy exact values.
- Fonts used:
  - **Source Sans Pro**: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - **Spin-Cycle-OT**: [Download Link](https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT-Regular)
- Some values in the design are floats (e.g., 12.45px) — you can round to nearest whole value.
- Images and icons can be replaced with similar placeholders if exact assets are not available.
